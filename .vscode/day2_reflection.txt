DAY 2 – DATA HANDLING REFLECTION

1. Problems I faced today:
-  confusion between terminal and Python shell,erroe in NaN handling, also trying to understand syntex)

2. Things that confused me at first:
- (why sales became float, groupby syntax)

3. What clicked clearly today:
- (Rows vs columns, list of dicts = table, why cleaning matters)

4. One question I still have:
- (df is use for for in syntex)

5. One sentence summary of Day-2:
- ( “Today I learned that data quality decides AI quality.”)
