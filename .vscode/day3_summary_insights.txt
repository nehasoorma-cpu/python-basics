DAY 3 — DATA UNDERSTANDING INSIGHTS

1. Data quality issues found:
- (Example: Missing sales values, missing dates, negative sales)

2. What the statistics reveal:
- (Example: Mean sales is higher than median, indicating skew)

3. Outliers observed:
- (Example: Very high sales values may represent special cases)

4. Why this matters for AI:
- (Example: AI trained on this data would overestimate revenue)

5. One decision I would make using this data:
- (Example: Focus on Indore city customers)
1. Why is mean sometimes misleading?
2. When should I NOT remove outliers?
3. How could bad data hurt business decisions?

AI does not understand:
whether data is realistic
whether numbers make sense
whether something is an error or truth
👉 YOU decide that.
Bad data causes:
biased models
wrong predictions
confident but incorrect AI
So today = human intelligence > machine intelligence
If mean ≠ median → data is skewed
High std → unstable business
Median often reflects re
👉 AI blindly optimizes mean unless you stop it
Never analyze raw data directly.
Always work on a copy.
Which column has missing values?
Would an AI model understand why it’s missing? → ❌
MCAR → random (safe-ish)
MAR → depends on another column (dangerous)
MNAR → depends on itself (very dangerous)
Dropping loses data
Filling keeps data but adds assumptions
There is no universal correct answer.
That’s why humans decide.
IQR ignores extreme noise
Much safer than mean/std
