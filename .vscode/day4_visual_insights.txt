Statistics summarize.
Visualization reveals structure.
AI models learn patterns.
Humans must see patterns first.
“How are sales values spread?”
ans: by sales disbution chart with frequency
HOW TO READ THIS
Tall bars → common values
Long tail → skew
Gaps → unusual behavior
Boxplot shows:
median
spread
outliers
This is how analysts justify removing outliers
“Which city performs better?” Indore
Is one city dominating? indore
Is data size equal across cities? No
Would AI over-prioritize one region? No
Is there a trend over time?” yes
AI models LOVE time patterns
Trends ≠ noise
Visuals help you see seasonality & spikes
Are sales stable or spiky? Spiky
Is growth consistent? NO
Are high sales isolated events? no
📌 This thinking prevents bad model assumptions.

- Which chart was most informative?

Which chart could mislead if misread?
Sales disbution
Scatter plots connect features → prediction.
This is where feature thinking starts.
ML models learn correlations, not meaning.

2. Which feature seems most predictive? data with time
