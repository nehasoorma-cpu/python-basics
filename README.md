# Python Basics Practice

# Sales Data Analysis — Mini Project

## Problem Statement
Analyze real-world sales data to understand patterns, data quality issues,
and ML readiness.

## Dataset Summary
- Transaction-level sales data
- Contains missing values and inconsistencies
- Cleaned conservatively for reliability

## Key Insights
- Sales data is skewed; median is more reliable than mean
- Regional differences strongly influence revenue
- Time-based patterns exist but are unstable

## Limitations
- Small dataset size
- No external factors (seasonality, promotions)

## Next Steps
- Feature engineering
- ML regression prototype
- Add external business data
